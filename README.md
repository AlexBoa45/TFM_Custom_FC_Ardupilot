# Master Thesis Project, UPC-EETAC: 
# Design and development of the control PCB for a drone with a study of potential space applications

By: Alejandro Boadella

During this early start of the XXI century, drones have taken a very important role in society in multiple aspects. Such as the transport of goods, reconnaissance activities, mapping, firefighting and more. The development of IoT and cheap electronics impulses and leads drones into a promising insight of a better future.

# Motivation and objectives

This TFM is devoted to learning, exploring and expanding knowledge of the basic components essential for creating autonomous devices.

Control and power distribution boards are critical subsystems in unmanned vehicles. This project focuses on the complete design process of a dedicated drone control PCB. Furthermore, it includes a study of potential space applications and their specific technical requirements.

The principal objectives of this TFM are:

- Develop a functional drone control PCB.
- Create the drivers to manage the drone control PCB with ArduPilot.
- Evaluate the current design and expose space requirements.

**All the objectives have been accomplished. This project was developed over 5 months and involved the design of my very first PCB. The result is a fully functional PCB that can be used in a drone and has been successfully ported to the ArduPilot firmware. The magnetometer and MicroSD capabilities are not yet functional and require further improvement; however, the remaining sensors and system capabilities are fully operational.**

**This repository contains all the documentation developed during the TFM. All the design has been developed in Altium. BOM, CPL, Gerber, Master thesis and additional files can be found in this repository.** 

NOTE: the explanation of how to port a custom PCB flight controller to ArduPilot, development of a boards, space analysis and more can be found in the thesis.
